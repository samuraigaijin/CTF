# 🛡️ CTF Writeups – Bruno Braga (samuraigaijin)

Welcome to my Cybersecurity CTF repository.

This repository contains writeups of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I solved, mainly from platforms like **TryHackMe**, focusing on:

- Web Application Security
- Enumeration & Recon
- Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Reverse Shells
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Real-world attack simulation

---

## 🎯 Objective

My goal with this repository is to:

- Document my learning process
- Improve technical writing skills
- Build a public portfolio focused on **Pentest Junior**
- Share methodology and tools used in real attack scenarios

All writeups are structured to demonstrate:
- Enumeration strategy
- Tools used
- Exploitation path
- Lessons learned

---

## 🧠 Platforms

- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/samuraigaijin)
- Local labs (WSL / Kali Linux)
- Personal test environments

---

## 🛠️ Tools Frequently Used

- `nmap`
- `gobuster`
- `ffuf`
- `nuclei`
- `Burp Suite`
- `netcat`
- `python`
- `wpscan`
- `searchsploit`
- `curl`
- `dirsearch`

Environment:
- WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- Kali Linux
- Custom lab setups

## 🧭 Methodology

Most web challenges follow this flow:

1. Reconnaissance  
2. Port scanning (`nmap`)  
3. Directory fuzzing (`gobuster`, `ffuf`)  
4. Technology fingerprinting  
5. Vulnerability scanning (`nuclei`)  
6. Exploit development or adaptation  
7. Reverse shell (when applicable)  
8. Post-exploitation & privilege escalation  

---

## 🚀 Career Focus

Currently working towards becoming a **Pentest Junior**, with strong interest in:

- Web Pentesting
- Red Team fundamentals
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Offensive Security

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All challenges documented here were performed in legal lab environments (CTF platforms or intentionally vulnerable machines).  
No real-world systems were targeted.
